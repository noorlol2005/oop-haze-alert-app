# Haze Alert (Java App) 🏙️🌥️

This was my first ever project in Java language. It's a group project to develop a Java-based application for osmething related to United Nations SDG-13. 

This app is about Haze alert.  Haze has been a major issue in Malaysia due to farmers in nieghboring Indonesia. We developed this app to suggest a potential solution for people who have asthama and suffer a lot in Haze conditions.

The documentation of this app has been published online and can be found here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387852548_Leveraging_Java_Programming_for_Climate_Action_Developing_a_Solution_to_Address_Air_Quality_and_Sustainable_Development_Goal_13
